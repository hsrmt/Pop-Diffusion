an option to show prompt/s over image
  maybe on top of(with or without a background), maybe above or below image
  maybe show it with put text onto each original X image so that it zooms or moves with the animation
  in order to do prompt overlay on top of interpolated video we need to make the video ourself with
        the interpolation output images

hook up another ai that determines category of antarctic phrases and choose artists/modifiers from list 

  bug:
    crashes sometimes from memory error
    if it crashes and resumes then i lose all the antarctica prompts

a way to load settings from settings file
  this would be instead of prompt presets

try antarctic with just an init image and either skip all steps on first prompt or get it to make even the first prompt
  so this way it is completely the ai deciding what to do

put lots of optional stuff at the very top instead of having it literred all around

interpolations should occasionally be saved and the whole thing should be in a loop so that if we get disconnected we can not lose images
  this means we need to check our output folder when determining what frame to start from
  maybe make a bunch of folders of non-interpolated images
    once we have the first folder complete and exist, we move the contents of the interpolated folder over to a complete interpolation folder
      then we start on the next batch
      a possible issue with this is that it starts filling the interpolation folder before it finishes and can take a little time
      another possible issue is naming issues, i don't know how it names interpolated images and if all these different folders wwill smoothly merge together

prompt "ramp" overwrite setting system:
  combined with arctic this could be cool

figure out a way to test code from in here
  maybe replace google drive with a local folder

convert frame skip steps into steps
  this can be a seperate input that goes below it and we can use one or the other. In fact, we can make a special print or something that gives us one if we give the other.

an estimated completion time would be cool, but probably difficult

info:
  limit size of stats
    reduce font size
  make stats show in two columns?
  show steps (the actual steps being used after skip steps was taken away)
  find other settings that would be useful to see

show any new setting that is being used there too
  maybe just show all settings here

save average it/s to new text file save list of changing settings to text file
  make sure this is happening

remember to make everything show in settings

learn about skip_augs

look into making models be done with the "new" system

possible to use new init images throughout the print? maybe something involving reverse or something to make it gradually go from one init to another through a prompt? not really thought out yet..

a way to make comparisons of two different changing settings or a control next to each other in one video. Ex: show two slideshows in the same video, in one of them sat_scale is changing, in the other one it is not, and everything else is the same.

a grid comparison of changing settings and their combinations, this could even be a 3d grid or a many dimension grid that is viewed by changing settings(between pre-defined, pre-printed settings) and seeing result in real time
