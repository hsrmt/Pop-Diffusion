bugs:
  figure out why sometimes there are no stats being shown

make settings overwrite its own cell

settings overwrite is making all the settings be strings. some settings need to be integers.
  go through all the settings in overwrite and compare them to their markdown inputs, if they should be ints then
    they need to be converted inside of the settings overwrite conditional
  there may also be this same issue with ones that are supposed to be lists
    ive seen no evidence of this yet, it needs to be checked

at the beginning, when we make the stats dict if there is a stats.txt then when we should fill it from there, not make it empty

hatice settings should be removed and put in their appropriate cells as inputs
  there are notes next to each of them for what to do with them

all created video files should be named with the batch name / num (see interp or normal videos as examples)

if an mp3 already exists, then dont download another one

if a gist already exists, then dont create another one

print the video description to a text file

take gist / github username as a variable, not hardcoded
  in 'create gist' cell

add gpu to stats

format new section headers like the old ones and number all sections
  (some stuff can be grouped, for instance interpolation has sever cells so it can be #.1, #.2, #.3, etc)

add object detection and antarctic prompt settings to settings.txt and the settings overwrite
  this can also be done for interpolation and other video creation settings, but needs some consideration
    i think we may want to look at this settings file at different places to use it to overwrite settings in different sections
      make the setting.txt overwrite input be at the beginning of the whole files
      we can also override models this way

make a ccmixter 'never again' mp3 list and check for it when getting music, if we get one in the list then loop 
  back and get another one
  -this should be in github AI/Pop_Diffusion/ccmixter_never_again_mp3_list.txt
  -take the url from the music credits (ex: http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/speck/52473) and put it into a list in the txt file
  -when getting a random mp3, check the list and if it is in the list, then get another one

a way to make specific settings go over the settings overwrite settings

make instructions on getting youtube jsons set up

maybe overwrite settings should somehow go at the beginning of the programs
would be nice to get absolutely everything put into settings and thus into overwrite settings

at the end of Setup Interpolation cell, compare interpolations to ..AI/Pop_Diffusion/interpolation_observations.txt to see
  if we can tell if the interpolation will fail for sure:
  if we have any failed interpolations with:
    the same gpu
    higher/equal frame dimensions, number of frames, interpolation number
  then we can say pretty much for sure it is going to fail. (although maybe we also have to take into account if another print is currently running)


clear space in gdrives

In settings overwrite there should be an option to use the same antarctic prompts again

3D Color stuff:
  test a long generation with color stuff to see if we can keep color

use the code here to get make and get boxes that can be zoomed into 
  https://hub-binder.mybinder.ovh/user/gereleth-jupyter-bbox-widget-fhggio0w/notebooks/examples/introduction.ipynb

figure out what point we are at with OD and get it working with specific items
  predefined objects to zoom into
  beyond:
    it asks what to zoom into while the print is happening
      this could even be done without OD and with a click and drag

some sort of random zoom in to a point thing without even using OD
  this could be done with a click and drag of a box over the image

test:
  test info and prompt videos without antarctic prompts
  test new antarctic text promp formating 

an option to show prompt/s over image
  maybe on top of(with or without a background), maybe above or below image
  maybe show it with put text onto each original X image so that it zooms or moves with the animation
  in order to do prompt overlay on top of interpolated video we need to make the video ourself with
        the interpolation output images

AP Eventually:
  hook up another ai that determines category of antarctic phrases and choose artists/modifiers from list 

OD Eventually:
  gpt3 can be used to combine object detected and current prompt into a new prompt

3D for color:
  if zippy 3d color fx works well,
    get PD set up for 3d and move color fx stuff over
    once this is done, maybe make the first frame become the color pallete for the rest with an option to change it to a later frame

  bug:
    crashes sometimes from memory error
    if it crashes and resumes then i lose all the antarctica prompts

try this without another machine running:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/GPT-J-6B/Inference_with_GPT_J_6B.ipynb#scrollTo=9vnZfO1HGSS7

OD and AP:
  if in loop and nothing happens for long enough then they should stop themselves
  how can antarctic prompts happen with one TPU and multiple main programs?
    a ranadom antarctic and is in the request image and resulting txt

H:


AP:

Interpolation:
  could be broken up into runs by using a wait system similar to OD and AP

multiply prompts by absolute multiplier
  special consideration must be given for antarctic prompts

Settings/Info files:
  other info text file should keep track of total time in (AP, DO, Pop Diffusion, Interpolation) Interpolation settings, GPU name
  info text file shuld also be in the gist or in a seperate gist

OD
  make an info print of the object that is being zoomed in on (this means send it over from the TPU)
  make a way for more settings to be input, number of frames to reach zoomed object, object to zoom in on if available
    pick either:
      number of frames to reach goal
      speed to head towards goal
      --------for both of these we probably want to pace it so that we reach both at the same time
  maybe sometimes we pick a target based on how much it has to do with current or next prompt, not sure
  maybe sometimes we use the label of the target to help create the next prompt with gpt3

Settings expirements:
  play with cut_pow less 1.0
  try antarctic with just an init image and either skip all steps on first prompt or get it to make even the first prompt
    so this way it is completely the ai deciding what to do

Live Interaction Stuff:
  a way to add prompts while generation is happening
  a button to cancel current frame/image and delete it

New Animaiton mode:
  make cutn scheduling have new animation mode so it can be different from frame to frame
  look into making models be done with the "new" system

Misc:
  when i do a series of images in a batch, i should be able to get the seed of each one (when it is on random)
  figure out about finetunning and see if can fine tune on zippys and discord channels to make a helpful DD bot
  a way to load settings from settings file
    this should override the settings in the markdowns
  possible to use new init images throughout the print? maybe something involving reverse or something to make it gradually go from one init to another through a prompt? not really thought out yet..
  a way to make comparisons of two different changing settings or a control next to each other in one video. Ex: show two slideshows in the same video, in one of them sat_scale is changing, in the other one it is not, and everything else is the same.
  a grid comparison of changing settings and their combinations, this could even be a 3d grid or a many dimension grid that is viewed by changing settings(between pre-defined, pre-printed settings) and seeing result in real time

Maybe:
  put lots of optional stuff at the very top instead of having it literred all around
  convert frame skip steps into steps
    this can be a seperate input that goes below it and we can use one or the other. In fact, we can make a special print or something that gives us one if we give the other.
  an estimated completion time would be cool, but probably difficult

Unknown:
  prompt "ramp" overwrite setting system:
    combined with arctic this could be cool
    (maybe this was just an early thought of the current AP system)

Meta:
  figure out a way to test code from in here
    maybe replace google drive with a local folder

Research:
  find out how many notebooks other people are running at same time in pro+
  learn about skip_augs
