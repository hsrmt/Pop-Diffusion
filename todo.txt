bugs:
  average step times not working
    figure out why sometimes there are no stats being shown

3D Color stuff:
  test a long generation with color stuff to see if we can keep color

get better at github with H so can have multiple branches going and merge smoothly

figure out what point we are at with OD and get it working with specific items
  predefined objects to zoom into
  beyond:
    it asks what to zoom into while the print is happening
      this could even be done without OD and with a click and drag

some sort of random zoom in to a point thing without even using OD
  this could be done with a click and drag of a box over the image

test:
  test info and prompt videos without antarctic prompts

an option to show prompt/s over image
  maybe on top of(with or without a background), maybe above or below image
  maybe show it with put text onto each original X image so that it zooms or moves with the animation
  in order to do prompt overlay on top of interpolated video we need to make the video ourself with
        the interpolation output images

AP Eventually:
  hook up another ai that determines category of antarctic phrases and choose artists/modifiers from list 

OD Eventually:
  gpt3 can be used to combine object detected and current prompt into a new prompt

3D for color:
  if zippy 3d color fx works well,
    get PD set up for 3d and move color fx stuff over
    once this is done, maybe make the first frame become the color pallete for the rest with an option to change it to a later frame

  bug:
    crashes sometimes from memory error
    if it crashes and resumes then i lose all the antarctica prompts

try this without another machine running:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/GPT-J-6B/Inference_with_GPT_J_6B.ipynb#scrollTo=9vnZfO1HGSS7

OD and AP:
  if in loop and nothing happens for long enough then they should stop themselves
  how can antarctic prompts happen with one TPU and multiple main programs?
    a ranadom antarctic and is in the request image and resulting txt

H:
  antarctic_text_prompts.json is formatted poorly, that text file should be formatted well like the settings.txt file
  in OD and AP TPU scripts, keep track of the last time work was actually done and if it has been more than a
    certain amount of time(timeout_minutes) then then stop the program
  make a stats dictionary, we will occasionally json dumps it to a file like we do the settings.txt file, give it these:
    frame_lengths
    average_frame_length
    antarctic_request_lengths
    average_antarctic_request_length
    object_detection_lengths
    average_object_detection_length
    
    
    
    set up timers before/after antarctic prompts requests and 

AP:

Interpolation:
  could be broken up into runs by using a wait system similar to OD and AP

multiply prompts by absolute multiplier
  special consideration must be given for antarctic prompts

Settings/Info files:
  other info text file should keep track of total time in (AP, DO, Pop Diffusion, Interpolation) Interpolation settings, GPU name
  info text file shuld also be in the gist or in a seperate gist

OD
  make an info print of the object that is being zoomed in on (this means send it over from the TPU)
  make a way for more settings to be input, number of frames to reach zoomed object, object to zoom in on if available
    pick either:
      number of frames to reach goal
      speed to head towards goal
      --------for both of these we probably want to pace it so that we reach both at the same time
  maybe sometimes we pick a target based on how much it has to do with current or next prompt, not sure
  maybe sometimes we use the label of the target to help create the next prompt with gpt3

Settings expirements:
  play with cut_pow less 1.0
  try antarctic with just an init image and either skip all steps on first prompt or get it to make even the first prompt
    so this way it is completely the ai deciding what to do

Live Interaction Stuff:
  a way to add prompts while generation is happening
  a button to cancel current frame/image and delete it

New Animaiton mode:
  make cutn scheduling have new animation mode so it can be different from frame to frame
  look into making models be done with the "new" system

Misc:
  when i do a series of images in a batch, i should be able to get the seed of each one (when it is on random)
  figure out about finetunning and see if can fine tune on zippys and discord channels to make a helpful DD bot
  a way to load settings from settings file
    this should override the settings in the markdowns
  possible to use new init images throughout the print? maybe something involving reverse or something to make it gradually go from one init to another through a prompt? not really thought out yet..
  a way to make comparisons of two different changing settings or a control next to each other in one video. Ex: show two slideshows in the same video, in one of them sat_scale is changing, in the other one it is not, and everything else is the same.
  a grid comparison of changing settings and their combinations, this could even be a 3d grid or a many dimension grid that is viewed by changing settings(between pre-defined, pre-printed settings) and seeing result in real time

Maybe:
  put lots of optional stuff at the very top instead of having it literred all around
  convert frame skip steps into steps
    this can be a seperate input that goes below it and we can use one or the other. In fact, we can make a special print or something that gives us one if we give the other.
  an estimated completion time would be cool, but probably difficult

Unknown:
  prompt "ramp" overwrite setting system:
    combined with arctic this could be cool
    (maybe this was just an early thought of the current AP system)

Meta:
  figure out a way to test code from in here
    maybe replace google drive with a local folder

Research:
  find out how many notebooks other people are running at same time in pro+
  learn about skip_augs
