bugs:
  figure out why sometimes there are no stats being shown
testing:
test interpolation things
test music song number
test interpolation_observations code
tj: 
  does settings overwrite work for items that are lists?
  we have option to show first prompt in youtube description
    maybe eventually put in the changing aspect of prompt
    maybe make it a function that takes in the prompt and the it maybe just blanks, or something like 1-100 or w/e
  Figure out why difuse has to be seperated and have video settings between itself
  learn how to make a gist branch and use it      
  list all features 
  get a settings.txt that is for quick testing with really low settings and use that for testing
  make a settings.txt that has core settings for face animations so that i can just leave that in 
    and not have to change everything every time
get noise injector hooked up
used_series in try_to_get_inbetween needs work, it should check the original series and see if they are something other than their default  
  that does nothing
change Box Zoom/OD to Guided Zoom/AI Guided Zoom
  is prompts hooked up to frame multiplier? it should be
  make instructions on getting youtube jsons set up for other used_series
  figure out why new users have to use DD before PD works for them
  get noise injector hooked up
  used_series in try_to_get_inbetween needs work, it should check the original series and see if they are something other than their default  
    that does nothing
  bug  : sometimes when i stop and start generating again, it generates from an earlier frame than i am actually at, 
            figure out why this happens and how to stop it. there is probably something counting completed frames and setting the start
            point from there, this should be in prepare diffuse

guided zoom:
  make instructions on how to use guided zoom next to guided zoom
  change Box Zoom/OD to Guided Zoom/AI Guided Zoom
  bug?:  doesnt seem to be zooming in as much as it should
  Eventually:
    hook up OD zoom
    possible to update position/size of box as zoom happens?

FIGURE OUT WHY BOX ZOOOM IS ACTING WEIRD

if ccmixter search has fewer than 40 results, then it crashes because 40 is hardcoded

custom film interpolation
  input is animation style "preceding frame #: (interp #),..."
  create a series from whatever is input
  current_interp_frame_num
  loop through all the frames:
    check to see if the next frame is already in interp folder,
    if it isn't:
      copy frame to interp folder and rename it based on current_interp_frame_num
    update current_interp_frame_num
    calculate how many frames should be in there for this interpolation
      frames_from_interpolation = 2 ** (interpolation_number) - 1
    check to see if at least this many frames exist in interp folder
      if they do:
        update current_interp_frame_num
        continue loop
      if they don't:
        do this interpolation
        rename the newly interpolated frames based on current_interp_frame_num
        update the current_interp_frame_num
    
    copy preceding fame to interp folder
    
Advanced Interpolation:
  a way to do different amounts of interpolation between different frames
    for example, between every (frame % 5 == 0) and (frame % 5 == 1), do lots of interpolating, and not much between the other frames

a way to force a specific ccmixter song to be downloaded
  maybe by inputting its url instead of a ccmixter search url


after text_prompt have something like text_overlay that can be used to show text 
over top of images - this can even get rid of the current text 
overlay system (just make sure that original images are preserved. this can be good for labeling lists of famous characters too.





make a ccmixter 'never again' mp3 list and check for it when getting music, if we get one in the list then loop 
  back and get another one
  -this should be in github AI/Pop_Diffusion/ccmixter_never_again_mp3_list.txt
  -take the url from the music credits (ex: http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/speck/52473) and put it into a list in the txt file
  -when getting a random mp3, check the list and if it is in the list, then get another one

how to start with all cells closed by default?

can dynamically morph from x to y using weights in for loops
  example: adorable: 10, creep: -10 ----> adorable: -10, creep: 10

dynamic way to fade through random artists to keep the fade smooth
  example: by 0:a,b,c ; 1:b,c,d ; 2:c,d,e... always just one artists coming and one going

at the end of Setup Interpolation cell, compare interpolations to ..AI/Pop_Diffusion/interpolation_observations.txt to see
  if we can tell if the interpolation will fail for sure:
  if we have any failed interpolations with:
    the same gpu
    higher/equal frame dimensions, number of frames, interpolation number
  then we can say pretty much for sure it is going to fail. (although maybe we also have to take into account if another print is currently running)

figure out a smooth way to preview ccmixter mp3s

In settings overwrite there should be an option to use the same antarctic prompts again

3D Color stuff:
  test a long generation with color stuff to see if we can keep color

use the code here to get make and get boxes that can be zoomed into 
  https://hub-binder.mybinder.ovh/user/gereleth-jupyter-bbox-widget-fhggio0w/notebooks/examples/introduction.ipynb

figure out what point we are at with OD and get it working with specific items
  predefined objects to zoom into
  beyond:
    it asks what to zoom into while the print is happening
      this could even be done without OD and with a click and drag

some sort of random zoom in to a point thing without even using OD
  this could be done with a click and drag of a box over the image

test:
  test info and prompt videos without antarctic prompts
  test new antarctic text promp formating 

an option to show prompt/s over image
  maybe on top of(with or without a background), maybe above or below image
  maybe show it with put text onto each original X image so that it zooms or moves with the animation
  in order to do prompt overlay on top of interpolated video we need to make the video ourself with
        the interpolation output images

AP Eventually:
  hook up another ai that determines category of antarctic phrases and choose artists/modifiers from list 

OD Eventually:
  gpt3 can be used to combine object detected and current prompt into a new prompt

3D for color:
  if zippy 3d color fx works well,
    get PD set up for 3d and move color fx stuff over
    once this is done, maybe make the first frame become the color pallete for the rest with an option to change it to a later frame

  bug:
    crashes sometimes from memory error
    if it crashes and resumes then i lose all the antarctica prompts

try this without another machine running:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/GPT-J-6B/Inference_with_GPT_J_6B.ipynb#scrollTo=9vnZfO1HGSS7

OD and AP:
  if in loop and nothing happens for long enough then they should stop themselves
  how can antarctic prompts happen with one TPU and multiple main programs?
    a ranadom antarctic and is in the request image and resulting txt

Controlled zoom
  


AP:

Interpolation:
  could be broken up into runs by using a wait system similar to OD and AP

multiply prompts by absolute multiplier
  special consideration must be given for antarctic prompts

Settings/Info files:
  other info text file should keep track of total time in (AP, DO, Pop Diffusion, Interpolation) Interpolation settings, GPU name
  info text file shuld also be in the gist or in a seperate gist

OD
  make an info print of the object that is being zoomed in on (this means send it over from the TPU)
  make a way for more settings to be input, number of frames to reach zoomed object, object to zoom in on if available
    pick either:
      number of frames to reach goal
      speed to head towards goal
      --------for both of these we probably want to pace it so that we reach both at the same time
  maybe sometimes we pick a target based on how much it has to do with current or next prompt, not sure
  maybe sometimes we use the label of the target to help create the next prompt with gpt3

Settings expirements:
  play with cut_pow less 1.0
  try antarctic with just an init image and either skip all steps on first prompt or get it to make even the first prompt
    so this way it is completely the ai deciding what to do

Live Interaction Stuff:
  a way to add prompts while generation is happening
  a button to cancel current frame/image and delete it

New Animaiton mode:
  make cutn scheduling have new animation mode so it can be different from frame to frame
  look into making models be done with the "new" system

Misc:
  when i do a series of images in a batch, i should be able to get the seed of each one (when it is on random)
  figure out about finetunning and see if can fine tune on zippys and discord channels to make a helpful DD bot
  a way to load settings from settings file
    this should override the settings in the markdowns
  possible to use new init images throughout the print? maybe something involving reverse or something to make it gradually go from one init to another through a prompt? not really thought out yet..
  a way to make comparisons of two different changing settings or a control next to each other in one video. Ex: show two slideshows in the same video, in one of them sat_scale is changing, in the other one it is not, and everything else is the same.
  a grid comparison of changing settings and their combinations, this could even be a 3d grid or a many dimension grid that is viewed by changing settings(between pre-defined, pre-printed settings) and seeing result in real time

Maybe:
  put lots of optional stuff at the very top instead of having it literred all around
  convert frame skip steps into steps
    this can be a seperate input that goes below it and we can use one or the other. In fact, we can make a special print or something that gives us one if we give the other.
  an estimated completion time would be cool, but probably difficult

Unknown:
  prompt "ramp" overwrite setting system:
    combined with arctic this could be cool
    (maybe this was just an early thought of the current AP system)

Meta:
  figure out a way to test code from in here
    maybe replace google drive with a local folder

Research:
  find out how many notebooks other people are running at same time in pro+
  learn about skip_augs
