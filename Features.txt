Features

Different Settings for different Frames
    -Most of the settings can be set like the animation settings in the format "frame#: (setting), frame#: (setting), ..."
    for example: cutn_batches - "0: (8), 100: (2)"
        this will make a series that goes down from 8 to 2 over the first 100 frames

Overwrite settings in notebook with settings.txt

Frame multiplier
    -every frame number in all the settings will be multiplied by the frame multiplier,
        this allows more frames to be added all at once without changing the relativity of the settings
